WAFPASS Analysing parameters with all payloads' bypass methods, aiming at benchmarking security solutions like WAF.


   Today a great number of website owners around the globe use “Web Application Firewalls” to improve their security. However, these security applications suffer from many deficits such as poor performance, lack of updates, and so forth. Thus, they are hindered from working effectively against everyday attacks that are equipped with cutting edge technological innovations. This vulnerability can cause various issues and even lead to security failures.
   
   WAFPASS’s ultimate goal is to present a solution for promoting security systems like WAF in addition to providing a general overview of the security solutions. 
   
   WAFPASS supports HTTP,HTTPS connections, GET and POST requests and the use of Cookies in order to access pages restricted to authenticated users. Also, an intercepting proxy can be set up.
